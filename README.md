Game Link : https://open-source-community.github.io/MazeRunner/mazestuffs/maze%20rendring/index.html

## How To Play:

- There are 5 main functions 
- ``` toty.movright(); ``` Moves the tank one block right
- ``` toty.movleft(); ``` Moves the tank one block left
- ``` toty.movup(); ``` Moves the tank one block up
- ``` toty.movdown(); ``` Moves the tank one block down
- ``` toty.isBlock(str) ``` Checks if the given direction has a block or not, for example if str equals 'right' and on the right 
of the tank there is a block then the function will return true.

- Use recursive algorithms to solve any maze using the isBlock function to create a generic algorithm, be creative.

- If you solved it try forking this repo and adding a screenshot of your submission code in the submission folder and pull request it, best answers shall be displayed.
